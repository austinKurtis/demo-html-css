				<h2>We are not in Kansas anymore</h2>
				<p>Oh, so she is! Well, bust my buttons! Why didn't you say that in the first place? That's a horse of a different color! Come on in! </p>
				<p>Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity. Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the Earth or slinks through slimy seas has a brain. Back where I come from, we have universities, seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out, they think deep thoughts and with no more brains than you have. But they have one thing you haven't got: a diploma.</p>
				<p>Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her!</p>
				<p>Scarecrow, you say you got no brain? Well, the surest sign you're talkin' to a dummy is when he tells you he knows it all! Takes a quality mind to know that there's always more to learn. You, my friend, are of that brainiac persuasion.</p>

					<h3>Ruby Slippers</h3>
					<p>The ruby slippers are the magic pair of shoes worn by Dorothy Gale as played by Judy Garland in the classic 1939 MGM musical movie The Wizard of Oz. Because of their iconic stature,[1] the ruby slippers are now considered among the most treasured and valuable items of film memorabilia.[2] As is customary for important props, a number of pairs were made for the film, though the exact number is unknown. Five pairs are known to have survived; one pair was stolen in August 2005[3] and has never been recovered.</p>
